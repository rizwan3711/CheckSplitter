# CheckSplitter


CheckSplitter is a convenient and fun app which allows you to split checks and calculate tips of varying percents when dining out with people. There is a minigame functionality built into the app, where you can choose from one of three activities to decide which diner will pay a little bit extra: either the tip, half the bill, or the grand total. 

CheckSplitter does a good job of demonstrating my comprehension of basic IOS/app development, such as the ability to use various property wrappers(@State, @ObservedObject, etc), navigate between views effectively, create aesthetically pleasing UIs, and add basic animations to enhance your app. The app was built around the standard MVVM development model, which I am comfortable working with.
